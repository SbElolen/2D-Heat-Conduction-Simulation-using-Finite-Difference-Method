# 2D-Heat-Conduction-Simulation-using-Finite-Difference-Method
This project is a Python-based tool that simulates and visualizes heat conduction across a 2D plate using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). The simulation provides a dynamic heatmap that shows how temperature propagates over time, given specific initial and boundary conditions.
