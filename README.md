2D Heat Conduction Simulation Using Finite Difference Method


This project is a Python-based tool that simulates and visualizes heat conduction across a 2D plate using the Finite Difference Method (FDM). The simulation provides a dynamic heatmap that shows how temperature propagates over time, given specific initial and boundary conditions. The tool can be used for educational purposes or basic thermal analysis.


 Features
--Dynamic Visualization: Watch real-time propagation of heat across the 2D plate.
--Configurable Parameters: Customize thermal diffusivity, time step, initial temperature, and boundary conditions.
--Variable Material Properties: Ability to define regions with different thermal properties.

 How It Works
The simulation is based on the 2D heat equation


 Usage Instructions
---Clone the Repository, use the script below:

git clone https://github.com/SbElolen/2d-Heat-Conduction-Simulation-using-Finite-Difference-Method.git
cd 2d-heat-conduction-simulation

Also run the Script below:

python heat_conduction_2d.py

---Adjust Parameters:
Modify parameters such as alpha, nx, ny, dt, and nt directly in the script.
Change boundary conditions and initial temperatures as needed.


 Potential Extensions
---2D Heat Transfer with Internal Heat Sources: Add internal heat sources and observe how they affect heat distribution.
---Time-Dependent Boundary Conditions: Implement boundaries that change temperature over time.
---User Interface: Create a GUI to easily modify simulation parameters.
